# CS189-Project-Final-T-Logistic-Regression

Learning objectives

- We teach logistic regression in week 4. We introduced logistic regression as a solution to classification problem by building concepts from linear regression model, which students have seen in 16B and previous weeks of 16ML. 

- Notes and slides gives theoretical concepts of classification problem, logistic regression model, loss function, evaluation metrics of classifiers, and how to optimize parameters in logistic regression model. 

- Quiz questions are about properties of sigmoid function and cross entropy loss in classification problem, comparing performance of different classifiers, and basic conceptual checkpoints. 

- In coding assignment, students will focus on binary classification problem to gain better intuition. They will implement a simple logistic regression model by hands, optimize its model parameters, and visualize its properties. They will get familiar with sklearn library, by applying LogisticRegression() and SGDClassifier() on Wisconsin breast and cancer dataset.


How to navigate this repository

- All required materials are saved in the root directory. “Logistic Regression Note” and “Logistic Regression Slides” are documentation including notes and slides. “Logistic Regression Quiz” and “Logistic Regression Quiz No Solution” are blank and solution versions. For coding assignment, there’s “Logistic Regression Coding Assignment Blank” and “Logistic Regression Coding Assignment Solution”. There’s no extra dataset.
